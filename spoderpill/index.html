                * The Spoderpill is not for everyone. Possible minor side effects<br>
                include increased appetite, stomach problems, diarrhea, and permanent<br>
                multicolorization ("clownification") of hair. Possible major side<br>
                effects include death, and irreversible changes to body appearance, voice, memories, and/or<br>
                the assimilation of all consumers into a singular being.<br>
                <br>
                The effects of the Spoderpill typically last up to 4 hours. In the<br>
                event the effects last longer than 4 hours, there's nothing you can<br>
                do but accept your fate. Consulting a doctor before taking Spoderpill<br>
                will be of no use, as its interactions with medication and the body vary wildly between persons.<br>
                <p></p>
                The SpoderFakes Corporation takes no responsibility for any side effects, listed or otherwise, that may occur from taking Spoderpill.<br>
